*** My Team Fortress 2 Scripts/binds/settings
**** TODO:
- Images of various settings effects in a nice document
- Map of keybindings
- Python script to change settings
- Improve readability
**** Requirements:
- [[https://mastercomfig.com/][Mastercom's Mastercomfig]]
	- you can choose any settings you want, however keep in mind that the any settings will be overwritten by ~modules.cfg~ and ~pre_comfig.cfg~, notably:
	  - the default preset will always be low (pre_comfig) exluding some overrides like antistropy and gibs/ragdolls (modules)
	  - settings like hiding chat by default is enabled (modules)
	  - vsync is enabled
	  - sound is set to ultra
	  - certain hud elements are enabled/disabled (player avatars etc)
- Up to date Team Fortress 2 (duh)
