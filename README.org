- Python script to change settings
- Improve readability
**** Requirements:
- [[https://mastercomfig.com/][Mastercom's Mastercomfig]]
	- you can choose any settings you want, however keep in mind that the any settings will be overwritten by ~modules.cfg~ and ~pre_comfig.cfg~, notably:
	  - The default preset will always be low (pre_comfig) excluding some overrides like anisotropy and gibs/ragdolls (modules)
	  - Settings like hiding chat by default is enabled (modules)
	  - Vsync is enabled
	  - Sound is set to ultra
	  - certain HUD elements are enabled/disabled (player avatars etc)
- Up to date Team Fortress 2 (duh)
